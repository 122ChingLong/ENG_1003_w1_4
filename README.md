## 01|Blackground of Path Planning to Aviation Engineering
• Path planning (also known as the navigation problem) 
is computational problem to find a sequence of valid configurations 
that moves the object from the source to destination. The term is 
used in aviation, robotics and computer games.

• Private pilots do the path plan before the flight to make sure the 
navigation aid is available
