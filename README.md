<!--Blackground of Path Planning to Aviation Engineering-->
## 01|Blackground of Path Planning to Aviation Engineering
• Path planning (also known as the navigation problem) 
is computational problem to find a sequence of valid configurations 
that moves the object from the source to destination. The term is 
used in aviation, robotics and computer games.

• Private pilots do the path plan before the flight to make sure the 
navigation aid is available

• For ATC near airports, collaborative path planning is required to make 
the best use of the crowded airspace

•Commercial pilot follow the path that plan based on different cost index 
designed by airlines.

• to select the best aircraft models with an 
optimized route that minimized the cost of the aircraft operation 
under given scenario.

• Design the cost of the aircraft operation

• Design an aircraft model (virtually) with different cost coefficients 
to fly safe and cheapest. 

• Design the path planning algorithm considering 3D, 2D + time, 
scenarios.

In this ENG course, I gained a lot. First of all, I learned about the basic application of Github and Python, the practical application of digital technology in the field of aviation engineering, and understood the importance of cross-field cooperation in the digital era. Detailed said, python is an easy to learn, simple programming language, grammar is very suitable for non-professional, learn from the programming and application to his specialty, so as to realize interdisciplinary cooperation and making is a very convenient team site, share and edit code make team work more simple and effective, It saves a lot of manpower and material costs. Combining the two, it can help the informatization development in the field of aviation engineering. Secondly, ENG is a team cooperation course. In the last two months, THIS course made me deeply realize the importance of team cooperation. The biggest advantage of team cooperation is that we can divide the work and cooperate, so as to give full play to the advantages of everyone, thus improving the efficiency and quality of the task.
